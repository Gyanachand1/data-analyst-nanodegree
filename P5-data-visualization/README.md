# Summary 
<!--In this project it will be visualized the population distribution in Spain for the year 2016. The data will be plotted in two different graphs, one for men and other for women. It will also be plotted the total distruvtion. The data is extracted from the **INE** (Instituto Nacional de Estadística de España/ Statistics National Institute of Spain) [[source]](http://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Tabla.htm?t=9663&L=0). Data comes ordered by age (1 year increments),

# Design 

<!-- When designing the graph, I tought that it would be great to have the distribution of population for male/female side by side, but reality turned out that it was much harder to achieve.

I decided to start with just men population. I dediced to plot the distributions in 5 years intervals, so more conclusions could be drawn.-->

1. Create a slopegraph showing lines between two variables: one related to money spent in health care and the other as life expectancy at date of birth.
	-	Show all connections, names of countries and data on each side.
	-	Highlight line when clicking and print country.
2. Remove all data printed and highlight only line on mouse over
3. Leave only maximum and minimum values for left and right variables.
	-  Print line connecting means between each side of the graph. 
	-  Set values to diplay only 1 decimal point.
4. Make data to appear when setting the mouse over the lines. 
	-	Show country and data for left and right variable
5. Separate data by continents.
	- In general: the higher the amount spent the greater the life expectancy.
	- Europe is the continent spending more money on health whereas Africa shows the lowes rate in health expenditure. This is reflected on the average life expectancy of both countries: Europe has an average life expentancy of 78.8 years where in Africa it is  61.3 years

6. Compare EU members vs non-members.
